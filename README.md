# Ross' dotfiles

A backup of the important dotfiles that I use. Cobbled together from many sources:

* `.hushlogin` and `.osx`: Mathias Bynens' awesome [dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles), from which this was forked.
* `.bash_profile`: [Phil Dokas](https://github.com/pdokas), plus a dash of [dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles).
